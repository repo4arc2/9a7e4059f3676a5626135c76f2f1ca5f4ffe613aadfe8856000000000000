1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:03,830
你来纽约是要找克林特交谈吗  你就是为了这个来这 
Are you in New York to talk to Clint? Is that why you're here?

2
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:04,950
我是来要他命的
I'm here to kill him.

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,540
有人雇佣了黑寡妇
Someone has hired a Black Widow.

4
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:09,450
- 如果我今晚不能和他们做个了断… - 克林特 我们都很小心
- If I don't end this tonight... - Clint, we've been so careful.

5
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:11,750
那个大人物出手是早晚的事
Matter of time before the big guy gets involved.

6
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:13,790
前情提要

7
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,410
妈妈 我真的得和你谈谈杰克的事
Mom, I really need to talk to you about Jack.

8
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,200
咱们能不能换个话题 
Hey, could we change the subject?

9
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:22,830
我需要你帮我决定 毕晓普节日聚会的事
I need your help with a few decisions on the Bishop holiday party.

10
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:24,200
要不咱们谈个条件 
What if that's our deal?

11
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:26,500
你帮我们找点做新衣服的材料
You get us materials for a new costume.

12
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:30,160
给你们足够的材料做衣服 你们再多做两件行不行 
How about enough materials to make your costumes plus two more?

13
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:33,160
我向你保证 这是个天大的误会
I promise you this is all a big misunderstanding.

14
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:35,200
很明显我是被陷害的
I've obviously been framed.

15
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,500
你老板想要你父亲的命
Your boss wanted your father dead.

16
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:46,830
对 就是你的老板
Yes. Your boss.

17
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:48,370
说这些干什么 
What is this?

18
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:51,200
那天晚上你为什么没来开会

19
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:53,660
你在说什么 
What are you talking about?

20
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:55,000
凯特 
Kate?

21
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:58,290
你看看这个 和我母亲在一起的是谁 
Look at this. Who's that with my mom?

22
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:03,410
这就是我一直担心的家伙
Well, that's the guy I've been worried about this whole time.

23
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:04,700
金并
Kingpin.

24
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:03,870
毕晓普女士
Ms. Bishop.

25
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:07,000
菲斯克先生
Mister Fisk.

26
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,410
你来找我干什么 埃莉诺 
What can I help you with, Eleanor?

27
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:26,040
咱们交情一直都不错 是吧 威尔逊 
We've had a good relationship, haven't we, Wilson?

28
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,290
是的
Yes.

29
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:31,620
我从来不多问 只按要求做事
I've never asked questions, I've always done what was told.

30
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:36,160
欠债的就应该这样 你丈夫欠我的钱可不少
What I'd expect when there's a debt, and your husband owed a small fortune.

31
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:38,870
那笔钱我已经还了十倍不止了
Which I have repaid tenfold by now.

32
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:42,200
你自己也没少得到好处
All the while doing pretty well for yourself.

33
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:46,290
如你所说 咱们交情还算不错
Like you said, it's been a good relationship,

34
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:50,870
所以我不能理解你现在想干什么
which is why I'm a little confused where you're headed with this.

35
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,160
我按你的要求解决了阿曼德
I handled Armand like you asked.

36
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:59,410
我的未婚夫替斯隆有限公司背了锅
My fianccé is taking the fall for Sloan.

37
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:04,290
但是我女儿现在回来了
But my daughter, my daughter is home now,

38
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:07,450
她离我太近了
and she's getting too close.

39
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:10,910
这是我的底线
And that's where I draw the line.

40
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,620
这一行里没有底线
There are no lines in this business.

41
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:15,370
所以我必须要退出
And that is why I have to leave this business.

42
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:16,580
埃莉诺 别这么草率
Eleanor, don't be rash.

43
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:17,580
我要让你知道
I want you to know

44
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:20,160
我一直留了个后手
that I have been keeping an insurance policy.

45
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:23,750
- 埃莉诺… - 我在安全的地方保存了所有记录
- Eleanor... - Copies of everything, in a safe place.

46
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:27,000
看在过节的份上 我给你一分钟
In the spirit of the holidays, I'm gonna give you a minute

47
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,200
认真考虑一下 你到底在干什么
to think about what you're starting right now.

48
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,830
我不需要
I don't need a minute.

49
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,120
看在过节的份上 我给你一分钟
In the spirit of the holidays, I'm gonna give you a minute

50
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,540
认真考虑一下 你到底在干什么
to think about what you're starting right now.

51
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:51,830
我不需要
I don't need a minute.

52
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:55,000
谁发来的 
Who sent this?

53
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:56,790
叶莲娜
Yelena.

54
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:02,660
看来是我母亲雇佣了她来杀你
Apparently my mom is the one who hired her to kill you.

55
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:12,870
这没道理 我母亲不是这种人 她都不会乱穿马路
It doesn't make any sense. My mom doesn't even, she doesn't even jaywalk.

56
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:15,830
她居然会给黑帮卖命 
And now she's working with the mob?

57
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:17,870
是她杀了阿曼德 
She killed Armand?

58
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:21,870
天啊 我得去问问她
My God, I need to talk to her.

59
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:24,540
凯特 等等 冷静一下 好吗 
Kate, wait. You gotta calm down, okay?

60
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:26,080
咱们把事说清楚
Let's talk this out.

61
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,000
你好 我是埃莉诺 现在不能接听你的电话
Hi, this is Eleanor. I can't answer the phone right now...

62
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,580
深呼吸 好吗 
Just take a breath, okay?

63
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:32,660
但是你妈妈需要我们的帮助
But your mom needs our help.

64
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:36,330
那个视频可不妙 凯特
That video, Kate, it's not good.

65
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:41,160
金并不会善罢甘休 他一定会报复
The Kingpin will not take this lightly. He is going to react,

66
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:42,950
而且他一定会狠狠地报复
and he's gonna do it in a big way.

67
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,410
克林特 我自己的事我自己处理
Clint, this is my mess to clean up.

68
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:48,000
你该回家去 你该去和家人团聚
You should go home, you should be with your family.

69
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,870
现在还赶得上圣诞节
You can still make it in time for Christmas.

70
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:51,910
凯特 你是我的搭档
Kate, you're my partner.

71
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:56,750
你的事就是我的事
Your mess is my mess.

72
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:59,870
事情解决之前 我哪也不去
I'm not going anywhere until this is finished.

73
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,790
她来了
Here she is.

74
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:24,790
之前有麻烦 你也能妥善处理 但是这次呢 
I've seen you at the end of some tough matches, but this?

75
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:32,540
你要不要给我讲讲怎么回事 
Do you want to tell me what's been going on?

76
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:43,410
我一直让你低调行事
I always taught you to keep a low profile.

77
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:50,950
抱歉 我太冲动了 你知道我父亲对我多么重要
I'm sorry. I got carried away. You know what my father meant to me.

78
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,540
他对我们所有人都很重要
To all of us.

79
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:02,160
我冷静下来了 我会专心做事
I've come to my senses. I need to focus on the job.

80
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:04,700
不会再继续无谓的追踪了
Stop chasing ghosts.

81
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,910
变得挺快啊
That's quite the turnaround.

82
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:25,700
我知道无论我做什么 我父亲都不能复生
I've realized no matter what I do, I can't bring my father back.

83
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:29,200
即便找到杀害他的凶手
Finding whoever killed him,

84
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:32,370
也无济于事
that won't change anything.

85
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:36,950
他也会希望你能向前看的 他一直希望…
He would've wanted you to move on. He always wanted...

86
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,910
你能过得幸福
The best for you.

87
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,790
我真希望他能在这里 看到你和所有的成就
I only wish that he could be here now to see you and all of your accomplishments.

88
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:55,500
如果您允许 我想休息几天 让自己清醒一下
If it's okay with you, I'd like a couple days off, to clear my head.

89
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:01,870
当然可以
Yes, that's reasonable.

90
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:05,700
玛雅…
Maya...

91
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:13,580
我爱你
I love you.

92
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:17,290
我爱你

93
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,410
浪人在城市里出没
The Ronin is running around the city.

94
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:40,910
有个复仇者盯上了我们的组织
An Avenger has taken an outsized interest in our operations,

95
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,120
还有那个叫毕晓普的女人
and the Bishop woman,

96
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:47,660
她竟然想退出 她以为自己是给高盛打工吗 
she thinks that she can quit her job, as if she works for Goldman Sachs.

97
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,870
还有玛雅…
And Maya...

98
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,500
我的玛雅…
My Maya...

99
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,330
她背叛了我们
She's turned on us.

100
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,250
没错
Yeah.

101
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:05,450
我们要怎么办 
What will we do about it?

102
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:13,700
我要提醒
The people

103
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,830
所有人
need to be reminded

104
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:20,540
这个城市是属于我的
that the city belongs to me.

105
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:30,040
凯特
Kate,

106
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,540
我很抱歉你遭遇的这一切
I'm really sorry how this has all turned out for you.

107
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:37,080
现在没时间多想
Can't think about it right now.

108
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:40,040
先集中精力解决今晚的事
We've gotta focus on tonight.

109
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:42,080
你说得对
You're right.

110
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:44,500
咱们需要很多装备
We need a ton of gear.

111
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:50,040
比如一大捆夺命特殊箭头
Like a whole batch of way-too-dangerous trick arrows.

112
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:54,330
你能造出来更多 
You can make more?

113
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:07,830
凯特 你知道胡椒喷雾在哪吗 
Hey, Kate, have you seen that pepper spray?

114
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:10,080
- 知道 在这呢 - 好的
- Yeah, I've got it here. - All right.

115
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:12,250
眼部刺激

116
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:27,700
皮姆科技

117
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:29,580
这是什么 
What is this one?

118
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,750
这玩意非常危险
Way too dangerous.

119
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:37,080
非常危险
Too dangerous.

120
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,660
气囊 - 冷冻 闪光弹 - 破冰

121
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:50,120
史塔克工业

122
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:18,870
那么 你母亲公司
So, this, uh, this holiday party tonight,

123
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,700
今晚的节日聚会 是很正式的那种吗 
is it a fancy thing?

124
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:25,290
对 很正式
Yeah. Formal.

125
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,000
其实你没必要这么做
You know, you don't have to do this.

126
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:34,870
这份工作就是这样
It is part of the job.

127
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,580
永远都很麻烦
It's always inconvenient.

128
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:42,700
永远都很孤独
It's lonely.

129
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:44,950
而且你还会受伤
You will get hurt.

130
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:48,830
英雄总是要面对一些艰难的决定
Heroes have to make some tough decisions.

131
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:53,620
所以 如果你真的要这么做…
So, if you're gonna do this...

132
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:57,370
我得确定你有心理准备
I just wanna know you're ready.

133
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,700
我小时候 外星人入侵了
When I was younger, aliens invaded.

134
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:15,910
当时只有我自己
And I was alone.

135
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,700
我吓坏了
And I was terrified.

136
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,000
但是我看见了你
But then I saw you,

137
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,120
用一把弓箭与外星人对抗
fighting aliens with a stick and a string.

138
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:35,040
我看到你从楼上纵身跃下 尽管你既不能飞
I saw you jump from that building even though you can't fly,

139
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:37,870
也没有任何超能力
even though you don't have superpowers.

140
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,370
那时我就在想
And I thought,

141
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,870
“如果他能这么做 那我就没什么可害怕的了”
"If he could do that, then I didn't have to be scared."

142
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,500
是你让我明白 英雄并不一定要会飞
You showed me that being a hero isn't just for people who can fly

143
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:54,080
并不需要用双手发射激光
or shoot lasers out of their hands,

144
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,000
任何人都可以成为英雄
it's for anyone,

145
00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:00,120
只要他敢于做正确的事情 不计较个人得失
who's brave enough to do what's right, no matter the cost.

146
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:09,620
我准备好了
I'm ready.

147
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,750
相信你的弟兄

148
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,040
我就位了
I'm in position.

149
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:38,250
如果那个叫毕晓普的女人想跑 做好准备
If the Bishop woman escapes, be ready.

150
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:42,120
我们在路上 托马斯负责东侧的出口 我负责西侧
We're on the route. Tomas has east exits, I have west.

151
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,660
我还没看见我妈妈
I don't see my mom yet.

152
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:04,000
要不说说你看见什么了吧 
Why don't you tell me what you do see?

153
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,410
哪些是对咱们有利的 哪些是威胁 
What are our assets, what are our threats?

154
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,330
威胁 那家伙就是
Mmm. Threats? That guy.

155
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:14,120
那是加里 我唯一的一份工作 就是被他炒掉的
That's Gary. He fired me from one of the only jobs I ever had.

156
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:17,120
有利的 
Assets?

157
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:19,830
那可到处都是
Well, we have those all over the party.

158
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:30,540
奇普 很高兴见到你
Chip. So good to see you.

159
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:34,160
杰克已经从监狱出来了 这家伙挺厉害
Wow. Jack's out of jail already. Nothing phases that guy.

160
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:37,120
看来杰克的本事不小
So Jack wielding a sword,

161
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,160
有人指控他是杀人凶手 还能从监狱里出来
just out of jail for allegedly murdering somebody with one.

162
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:43,160
也许他想这样证明 自己真的是无辜的
Maybe it's his way of proving that he really is innocent?

163
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:44,750
匪夷所思 就这样吧
It's a weird flex, but sure.

164
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:47,830
你好 杰克 我以为你还在监狱里
Hey, Jack. I thought you were in jail.

165
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:50,500
我确实进监狱了 不过你父亲把我保释出来了
I was, until your father bailed me out.

166
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,700
妈妈说你的红酒收藏都是我的了
Mom said I was gonna get your wine collection.

167
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:56,160
什么 想品尝我的美酒 你还没到岁数呢
What? You're not old enough to appreciate my wine collection.

168
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:57,410
总有一天我可以的
Well, I will be someday.

169
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,620
问题是那时适饮期就过了
The problem is it will have peaked by then.

170
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,700
只要你回监狱去就没问题了
Not if you go back to jail, it won't.

171
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:04,830
你还记得在汉普顿尿裤子的事吗 
Do you remember when you peed in your pants in The Hamptons?

172
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:06,790
我记得 所有人都记得
I do. Everybody does.

173
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,410
拿着这个
Take this.

174
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,040
保持联络 好吗 
Stay on comms, okay?

175
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,870
- 好的 - 我去转一圈
- Okay. - I'm gonna take a lap.

176
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:28,830
给您
There you go.

177
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:33,200
- 需要帮您存衣服吗  - 不用 谢谢
- Wanna check your coat? - No, thank you.

178
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:34,620
那好吧
Okay, then.

179
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:43,950
你看见她了吗 
Do you see her?

180
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,580
还没有
No, I haven't seen her yet.

181
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:06,000
我看见她了
I found her.

182
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:10,910
- 凯特 你好 - 妈妈 跟我来
- Kate, hi... - Mom, come with me.

183
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:18,120
你在干什么 
What are you doing?

184
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,540
我在救你的命
I'm saving your life.

185
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:21,700
你的生意伙伴想杀了你
Your business partner wants you dead.

186
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:23,000
你在说什么 
- What are you talking about?

187
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:30,250
所以我不能理解你现在想干什么
...which is why I'm a little confused where you're headed with this.

188
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:34,040
- 你怎么可以这样 这么多年以来… - 我按你的要求解决了阿曼德
How could you do this? -I handled Armand like you asked. - All these years.

189
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,040
你不明白
You don't understand.

190
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,790
你父亲的去世让我措手不及
When your father died, I was blindsided.

191
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,950
他欠那个怪物钱
He owed that monster money.

192
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:44,950
你们两个在这啊 不好意思打扰了 亲爱的
There you two are! Sorry to interrupt, darling,

193
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,120
但是我真的需要和你说句话
but I really need to have a word with you...

194
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,660
杰克 等会再说
Jack, not now.

195
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:52,410
凯特 亲爱的 别担心 一切都在我的掌控之中
Sweetheart, Kate, don't worry about it, I have everything under control.

196
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,160
没有异常 老大
All clear, boss.

197
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,700
给你个惊喜
Surprise, surprise.

198
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,080
趴下
Get down.

199
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:16,620

What the...

200
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:17,870
- 你还好吗  - 我没事
- You okay? - Yeah.

201
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:19,450
- 把这些人带出去 - 好的
- Get these people out of here. - Yeah.

202
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,700
离窗户远点
Away from the window, away from the window!

203
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:30,000
趴下 弯腰
Stay down! Stay down.

204
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:32,750
这边 米茜 帮个忙 过来
This way. Missy, a little help. Come on.

205
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:35,620
巴顿在这 那个女孩也在
Barton's here, and the girl.

206
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:38,910
告诉老板提前过圣诞了
Tell the boss Christmas came early.

207
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,250
那是什么声音 
What the hell was that?

208
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:43,080
有人开枪 我们正在疏散人群
Shots fired. We're workin' on gettin' these people outta here.

209
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,620
妈妈 杰克 待在这别动
Mom and Jack, stay here.

210
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:47,080
凯特 别出去 太危险了
Kate, do not go out there, it's too dangerous.

211
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,750
危险都是你一手造成的 妈妈
You're the reason it's dangerous out there, Mom.

212
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:52,000
待在这别动 别插手
Just stay put and stay out of this.

213
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:57,830
我说…
You know...

214
00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:00,410
我好像不太了解情况
I feel like I'm missing something here.

215
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:06,910
好吧 杰克 就是现在
Okay, Jack, this is it.

216
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:09,500
该你大显身手了
It's your time.

217
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:13,120
快过来
Come on, come on.

218
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,620
天啊 克林特 谁在开枪 
Oh, God. Clint, who's shooting?

219
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:19,910
我也不知道
I have no idea.

220
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,370
- 克林特 - 你好
- Clint. - Hey.

221
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:22,660
- 去找埃莉诺 - 好的
- Find Eleanor. - Okay.

222
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:25,790
我下楼去引开火力
I'm gonna head downstairs, draw the fire away.

223
00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:28,540
收到 各位 咱们去二号位
Copy that. We're going position two, guys.

224

Wendy and Missy.

225
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:30,540
把灯关掉
Kill the lights.

226
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:33,830

Shit.

227

我知道你和我母亲挺熟
So, I know you're chummy with my mom,

229
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,660
但是我觉得 应该没人邀请你来圣诞聚会
I didn't think you'd make the cut for the Christmas party.

230
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:48,250
凯特·毕晓普
Kate Bishop.

231
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:50,790
我不是来捣乱的
I'm not here to ruin anything.

232
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:55,330
我就是来杀掉巴顿 吃些点心 然后我就走了
I'm just going to kill Barton, have some appetizers, and then I'll go.

233
00:17:56,330 --> 00:17:59,830
那就好好吃你的烤面包吧 估计你已经找不到他了
I hope you enjoy the bruschetta, 'cause it looks like you already lost him.

234
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:01,040
他在电梯里
He's in the elevator.

235
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,750
是 那又怎么样 有65层楼呢
Yeah, what, out of 65 floors,

236
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:05,910
你这么神通广大 能猜到他在哪一层 
you think you're just gonna magically guess which one he's on?

237
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,290
- 十二层 - 该死

241
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:56,080
- 你打我干什么  - 我也不知道

244
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:06,620

请大家有序离开
Yep. Please, please proceed at an orderly, orderly manner.

249
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:32,160
有序离开 你们还是大喊大叫 互相推搡吧
Orderly, or, you know, just keep yelling and shoving each other.

250
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:33,700
他们朝着你去了
They're coming to you.

251
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:37,620
红色一号已就位
Red One in position.

252
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:41,330
托马斯会守住出口 我带队进去

凯特的母亲不在这里
Kate's mom's not here.

After I kill Barton.

对 那一脚挺厉害
Oh, yeah. That was a good one.

268
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:33,830
动作特别到位 你的背摔也挺厉害
That was good form. But you did the really cool body throw.

269
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:35,500
- 谢谢你 - 好吧
- Yeah, thank you. Thank you. - Yeah.

别跟我套近乎了
Stop making me like you.

271
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:40,330
抱歉 我可是真心的 跟你打得很开心
I'm sorry, I can't help it. That was really fun.

272
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:41,950

It's Yelena. Watch out!

275
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:25,450
害怕就对了 好吧
It's supposed to be scary, it's supposed to be scary. Okay.

276
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,160
你在干什么 
What are you doing?

277
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:47,330
凯特 你没事吧 
Kate! You okay?

278
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:48,750

00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,290
克林特 运动服黑手党来了

弟兄们 是凯特·毕晓普
Look! It's Kate Bishop.

281
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:09,370
我知道现在不是时候
I know it's not the best moment right now,

282
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:11,000
但是我想谢谢你
but I want to thank you, you know.

283
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:13,830
谢谢你给我的建议 告诉我该怎么和女朋友交流
For your advice, how I should speak to my girlfriend.

284
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:15,750
- 有用吗  - 真的有用
- Did it work? - It worked, bro,

285
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:17,580
我们改去魔力红的演唱会了
we went to Maroon 5 instead.

286
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:20,160
真不错 那你拿枪干什么 
That's so great. So, what's with the gun?

287
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:23,040
抱歉 但是…我就是想说声谢谢
I'm sorry, but... I wanted to thank you.

288
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:27,750
这次别想跑了 哥们
I got you now, bro.

289
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:30,870
- 杰克 - 你好 亲爱的
- Jack! - Hello, sweetie!

290
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:32,000
小心身后
Behind you!

291
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:37,830
杰克 抱歉我妈把你送进监狱 你还好吗 
Jack. Jack, I am, I am so sorry my mom got you put in jail. Are you okay?

292
00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:39,040
再好不过了
Never been better.

293
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:45,910
但是恐怕我不知道你母亲去哪了
But I'm afraid I've lost track of your mother.

294
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,580
是啊 咱俩一样
Yeah. You and me, both.

295
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:18,790
我要跟你好好玩玩
I'm gonna enjoy this.

296
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:31,040
我告诉过你收手
I told you to stop.

297
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:34,910
一切因你而起 现在我来做个了断
You started all this. And now I have to finish it.

298
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:41,620
他在那
There he is.

299
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,200
你说得没错 卡齐
You're right, Kazi.

300
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:02,950
确实挺好玩的
That was fun.

301
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:13,250
真是过节了
This is some Christmas.

302
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:38,620

305
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:52,500
- “这”是哪 克林特 - 我在树上
- Where's "here," Clint? - In the tree.

306
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:53,750
什么树 
What tree?

307
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:55,410
那棵圣诞树
The tree!

308
00:25:56,950 --> 00:25:58,910
你在树上干什么 
What're you doing up there?

309
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,330
看风景呗 你以为呢 
I'm just hangin' out, what do you think?

310
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,250
各位 我的装备呢 
Guys! Guys, where's my gear?

311
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:05,540
- 我需要装备 - 米茜

312
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:07,000

I got it. I got it.

313
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,750
- 看见我妈了吗  - 没有
- Any eyes on my mom yet? - Not yet.

314
00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:12,410
没有 好吧 我得先把克林特 从那棵树上弄下来
No? Okay. Look, I need to get Clint out of that tree.

315
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:13,660
让人们离远点
Clear the civilians for me.

316
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:15,870
那家伙怎么办 他好像不是…
What about that guy? He doesn't seem to...

317
00:26:16,330 --> 00:26:17,160
看招
Take that!

318
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:19,370
他是咱们这边的 但是让他也躲开吧
He's on our side, but we should get him out, too.

319
00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:21,000
- 好 - 好的 祝你好运
- All right. - All right. Good luck.

320
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:27,580
这边 快走 咱们…这边走
This way. This way. You just go. Go, go. Let's do... This way.

321
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:29,950
这些人太不听话了
These people are terrible at following directions.

322
00:26:30,410 --> 00:26:32,910
各位 我觉得是时候了
Hey, guys. I think it's time.

323
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,290
你确定吗 
Are you sure?

324
00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:37,410
确定 咱们是受过专业训练的 但是现在远远不够
Yeah. I mean, we're trained professionals, but that's not enough now.

325
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,410
- 来吧 - 好
- Let's go. - Okay.

326
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:08,410

00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:32,950
凯特 咱们的后援在哪 
Kate, where's our backup?

330
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,450
这下可完蛋了
We're all gonna die.

331
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:50,200
- 你们准备好了吗  - 准备好了

把我放下 立刻
Put me down! This instant!

338
00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:06,950
我在救你的命 你这个小崽子
I'm trying to save your life, you brat!

339
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,080
你知道我是谁吗 
Do you know who I am?

340
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:10,620
克林特 你得抓紧了
Clint, I need you to hang on tight.

341
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:11,910
还用你说 
Yeah, you think?

342
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:15,410
等等 你什么意思 
Wait, wait. What do you mean?

343
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:17,120
我要把你从树上弄下来
I'm gonna get you out of that tree.

344
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:19,700
不 别乱来 凯特
No, no, don't do anything. Kate?

345
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:20,910
我自己能下去
I'm gonna get out myself.

346
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,500
是要我说“听我号令”吗 
You want me to say, ''On my signal''?

347
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:24,750
凯特 别乱来
Kate, please don't do anything.

348
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:26,500
好吧 那不说了
All right, I won't say it then.

349
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:27,950
跟着我说
Repeat after me,

350
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:30,290
“我不会做蠢事”
''I'm not gonna do anything incredibly stupid.''

351
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:36,450
凯特 怎么回事
Kate, what just happened?

352
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,330
- 凯特 不要 - 倒喽
- Kate, do not! - Timber.

353
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,700
这里太开阔了 咱们快走
We're too exposed. Let's go.

354
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:33,700
我的枪
My gun!

355
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:39,700
这应该能拖住他们一阵
That should hold them off for a bit.

356
00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:42,330
- 天啊 你居然穿了 - 是啊
- Oh, my God, you wore it! - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

357
00:29:42,410 --> 00:29:44,540
- 天啊 太漂亮了 我就知道 - 是啊
- Oh, my God, it looks so good, I told you. - Yeah.

358
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:47,000
听我说 咱们得离开冰场 好吗 
Listen to me. We need to get off this ice, okay?

359
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:49,750
离开冰场唯一的路就是那些台阶
The only way off this ice is up those stairs.

360
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,700
没问题 他们也就一千人 咱们有两人呢
Great. There's only about a thousand of them and two of us.

361
00:29:55,790 --> 00:29:57,450
这些给你 拿好了
Here, take these.

362
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:58,660
非常危险

363
00:29:58,750 --> 00:30:01,290
不会吧 现在合适吗 
No way. Is it time?

364
00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:02,950
合适
It's time.

365
00:30:04,370 --> 00:30:05,200
好吧 凯特
All right, Kate.

366
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:09,790
让他们尝尝咱们的厉害
Let's give 'em hell.

367
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:40,290
- 干掉他们 - 撞死他们
-Get them! -Run them over!

368
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:51,910
- 天啊 - 怎么回事 
- Oh, my God! - What happened?

369
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:57,500
他们现在怎么样了 
What happens to them now?

370
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:58,540
我也不知道
I don't know.

371
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:00,870
这我得问问斯科特
I'll have to ask Scott about that one.

372
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:07,660
好吧 那就这样吧
Well, there's that.

373
00:32:13,370 --> 00:32:14,290
走吧
Let's go.

374
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:20,950
凯特 你妈妈刚从侧门出来
Kate, your mom just came out the side door.

375
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,160
收到
Copy.

376
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:23,870
我得去找她
I gotta go find her.

377
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:26,160
- 你行吗  - 没问题
- You okay? - Yeah.

378
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:34,660
你去吧
Just go.

379
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:46,120
箭法不错
Nice shot!

380
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:47,950
废话
Yeah, no shit!

381
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:08,250
你应该离开的 玛雅

382
00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:09,160
永远都别回来

383
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:11,660
你知道我是万不得已
You know what I have to do.

384
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,200
在我杀了你之前
Before I kill you,

385
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:28,290
我有个问题要问你
I need to ask you one question.

386
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,500
很高兴终于见到你了
It's nice to finally meet you,

387
00:33:32,370 --> 00:33:33,200
叶莲娜
Yelena.

388
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:40,410
我要知道发生了什么
I need to know what happened.

389
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:48,870
听我说 叶莲娜
Look, Yelena,

390
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:56,410
就算我告诉你发生了什么 你也不会相信我
if I told you what really happened, you'd never believe me.

391
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:58,040
但是你要知道的是
But what you need to know

392
00:33:59,910 --> 00:34:01,830
你姐姐牺牲了自己
is your sister sacrificed herself,

393
00:34:03,450 --> 00:34:04,830
拯救了世界
and she saved the world.

394
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:07,540
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

395
00:34:12,290 --> 00:34:13,370
你在说谎
You're lying.

396
00:34:13,950 --> 00:34:15,700
- 什么  - 你这个可悲的家伙
- What? - You're pathetic.

397
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:17,700
太可悲了
You're so pathetic.

398
00:34:23,870 --> 00:34:25,410
我不想杀了你

399
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:29,450
我想把这一切都忘掉

400
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:31,620
和你一起

401
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:35,700
你还不明白吗 
Don't you understand?

402
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:40,000
这就是我的人生 玛雅
This is my life, Maya.

403
00:34:42,410 --> 00:34:44,080
这是我的人生
My life!

404
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:46,250
但是你的人生没必要这样
It was never supposed to be yours!

405
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:50,290
别逼我这么做 玛雅
Don't make me do this, Maya.

406
00:34:59,410 --> 00:35:01,120
咱们得找到凯特 我觉得她…
We have to find Kate. I think she's...

407
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:10,080
别走 埃莉诺
Don't leave, Eleanor.

408
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:12,000
过来 咱们谈谈
Come here. Let's talk.

409
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,330
放开我妈妈
Get away from my mom!

410
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:20,410
你拿那玩意想干什么 
What are you gonna do with that?

411
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,200
什么 
What?

412
00:35:44,410 --> 00:35:46,250
我和你不一样
I'm not like you.

413
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:48,080
好吗 
Okay?

414
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,620
太晚了
It's too late.

415
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:52,330
还不晚

416
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:55,500
只要你能勇敢地作出选择

417
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:57,330
咱们可以一起离开

418
00:35:57,910 --> 00:35:59,410
他不会善罢甘休的
He won't let that happen.

419
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:04,370
我没法同时在两个世界生存

420
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:39,370
走吧 玛雅 他会来抓你的
Leave, Maya. He's coming for you.

421
00:36:49,870 --> 00:36:51,040
你想去哪 大块头 
Where you goin', big guy?

422
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:54,580
别不识好歹
You're in over your head!

423
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,290
没有人杀害她
Nobody killed her.

424
00:37:13,370 --> 00:37:14,330
是她自己做出了选择
She made a choice.

425
00:37:14,410 --> 00:37:15,620
别骗人了
Stop lying!

426
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,250
你认真听我说
You're not listening to me.

427
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:28,700
她牺牲了她自己 你明白吗 
She sacrificed herself, understand?

428
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,330
我阻止不了她
I couldn't stop her.

429
00:37:34,330 --> 00:37:35,250
不可能
No.

430
00:37:51,250 --> 00:37:52,830
少管闲事
Mind your own business!

431
00:38:04,790 --> 00:38:07,580
她凭什么要为你牺牲自己 
Why would she sacrifice herself for you?

432
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,790
你配吗 
Why do you deserve it?

433
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:10,830
我不配
I don't.

434
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:14,160
所以你就眼睁睁地看着她去送死
So she died because you let her.

435
00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:15,790
我努力阻止她了
I fought for it.

436
00:38:16,910 --> 00:38:18,200
但是她比我厉害
But she was better than me.

437
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:21,160
你努力得还不够
You should've fought harder.

438
00:38:28,330 --> 00:38:29,330
等等
Wait.

439
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:46,200
你真的把我惹火了
You're really starting to annoy me.

440
00:38:53,290 --> 00:38:54,290
非常危险

441
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,290
妈妈 你没事吧 
Mom?

442
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,580
- 妈妈  - 凯特
- Mom? - Kate.

443
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,330
你还好吗 
Are you okay?

444
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:20,750
我很抱歉
I'm so sorry.

445
00:39:21,370 --> 00:39:23,000
我很抱歉 亲爱的
I'm so sorry, baby.

446
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:26,290
咱们一定能挺过去的 一定能
We're gonna put at this behind us. You'll see.

447
00:39:26,370 --> 00:39:28,790
好吗 一切都会回归正常的
Okay? It will all go back to normal.

448
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,750
从来都没正常过 妈妈
It's never been normal, Mom.

449
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:37,830
我心里一直有这种感觉
I think part of me has always known that.

450
00:39:37,910 --> 00:39:41,750
亲爱的 这次是我处理得欠妥
Honey, this was just an unfortunate arrangement.

451
00:39:41,830 --> 00:39:42,910
现在一切都结束了
And it's over.

452
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:45,750
杀害阿曼德 
Killing Armand?

453
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:49,660
雇佣杀手追杀克林特 
Hiring an assassin to kill Clint?

454
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:51,700
陷害你自己的未婚夫 
Framing your own fianccé?

455
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:54,660
这就是你说的“处理欠妥” 
That's an unfortunate arrangement?

456
00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:55,830
是的 亲爱的
Yes, sweetie.

457
00:39:55,910 --> 00:39:57,700
这个世界就是这样的
That's how the world works.

458
00:39:58,450 --> 00:39:59,910
我一直在保护你
I've protected you from it.

459
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:04,200
也许你不知道前因后果 但是这一切都是为了你
You may not have known what was going on, but I did it for you.

460
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:09,330
我知道一无所有的滋味 你受不了的
I know what it's like to have nothing. And you can't handle it.

461
00:40:09,910 --> 00:40:11,910
你怎么知道我受不了 
How do you know what I can handle?

462
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,580
因为我了解你
- Because I know you.

463
00:40:14,450 --> 00:40:18,830
我知道你觉得做事可以不考虑后果
And I know that you think that you can live life without consequences,

464
00:40:18,910 --> 00:40:20,040
就像你父亲一样
just like your father.

465
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:24,200
但是总要有人收拾残局 总要有人承担责任
But someone has to clean things up. Someone has to take responsibility.

466
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:27,040
- 你说得对 - 毕晓普女士
- You're right. - Mrs. Bishop.

467
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:31,040
你因为涉嫌谋杀 阿曼德·杜凯恩三世被逮捕了
You're under arrest for the murder of Armand Duquesne The Third.

468
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:32,330
请你转过身去
Turn around, please.

469
00:40:35,290 --> 00:40:37,290
这就是英雄的所作所为吗 
Is this what heroes do?

470
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:41,080
在圣诞节逮捕自己的母亲 
Arrest their mothers on Christmas?

471
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:43,200
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

472
00:40:46,330 --> 00:40:47,370
我爱你 妈妈
I love you, Mom.

473
00:40:48,290 --> 00:40:49,200
走吧
Let's go.

474
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:14,040
你怎么知道这个的 
How do you know that?

475
00:41:20,830 --> 00:41:22,580
你和娜塔莎的口哨暗号
Your secret whistle with Nat.

476
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:26,410
她总是提起你 叶莲娜
She talked about you all the time, Yelena.

477
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:28,330
真的吗 
She did?

478
00:41:31,290 --> 00:41:33,040
她说什么了 
What did she say?

479
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:38,040
她告诉我你们两个从小就分开了
She told me about how you got separated as kids.

480
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:43,250
她在开飞机
She was flying that plane.

481
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:48,830
我问她害不害怕
I asked her if she was scared.

482
00:41:52,330 --> 00:41:55,910
她满脑子想的都是你的安全
All she could think about is that you were safe.

483
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:02,080
从来没改变过 叶莲娜
That never changed, Yelena.

484
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:05,330
她爱你
She loved you.

485
00:42:06,830 --> 00:42:08,450
她一直希望你平平安安
And always wanted you safe.

486
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:26,160
你和她相处了这么长时间
You got so much time with her.

487
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:30,500
是的
Yes, I did.

488
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:34,660
结果不应该是这样
It shouldn't have gone this way.

489
00:42:35,830 --> 00:42:38,410
要是我在 就能阻止这一切 就能…
If I was there, I could have stopped it. I could have...

490
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:42,040
- 就能改变这一切 - 什么也阻止不了她的 叶莲娜
- I could have changed it. - Nothing was gonna stop her, Yelena.

491
00:42:44,410 --> 00:42:45,620
你了解娜塔莎
You know Natasha.

492
00:42:52,830 --> 00:42:54,200
她作出了选择
She made her choice.

493
00:42:58,750 --> 00:43:01,160
咱们得想办法接受这个选择
We're gonna have to find a way to live with that.

494
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:06,870
我太爱她了
I loved her so much.

495
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,120
我也是
Me too.

496
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:52,790
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

497
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:16,080
他不在这里 他跑了
He's not here. He's gone.

498
00:44:37,790 --> 00:44:39,120
真让我意外
What a surprise.

499
00:44:43,950 --> 00:44:44,950
玛雅
Maya.

500
00:44:46,910 --> 00:44:47,950
你和我…
You and I...

501
00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:50,040
咱们是一家人
We're family.

502
00:44:51,370 --> 00:44:52,370
一家人
Family.

503
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:58,370
一家人难免有分歧
Sometimes family doesn't see eye to eye...

504
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:07,580
听我说 这不是我们干的
Look. We didn't do any of that.

505
00:45:07,660 --> 00:45:09,910
你们得确定别抓错人了
We just wanna make sure you arrest the right people.

506
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,290
对 我们是好人
Yeah, we're the good guys.

507
00:45:11,370 --> 00:45:13,290
对 我们是和鹰眼一起的
Yeah. We are with Hawkeye.

508
00:45:13,370 --> 00:45:15,250
- 我们内心都是复仇者 - 对
- We're essentially Avengers. - Yeah.

509
00:45:15,330 --> 00:45:16,160
对了
You know,

510
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:19,330
我刚才看见你用剑了
I saw you with your sword earlier.

511
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:21,620
你身手不错啊
Pretty handy with that thing.

512
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:24,250
你听说过角色扮演吗 
Have you ever heard of LARPing?

513
00:45:26,250 --> 00:45:27,660
角色扮演 
LARPing?

514
00:45:27,750 --> 00:45:29,660
是什么娱乐消遣吗 
Is that some sort of leisure activity?

515
00:45:31,830 --> 00:45:34,160
我在这个公会里…
Well, I'm in this guild and...

516
00:45:34,250 --> 00:45:35,330
该死
Balls!

517
00:45:36,330 --> 00:45:38,330
血迹沾到我的领带上了
Think I got some blood on my tie.

518
00:45:45,950 --> 00:45:48,790
我要跟你说点真心话 凯特
You know, I gotta be really honest with you, Kate.

519
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:54,410
这种事并不寻常 但是…
It doesn't happen too often, but...

520
00:45:56,700 --> 00:45:58,330
每过一段时间
every once in a while,

521
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:01,700
你就会遇到某个人
you come across somebody

522
00:46:03,790 --> 00:46:05,700
让你从各个方面…
that just makes you better...

523
00:46:08,370 --> 00:46:09,750
变得更出色
in every way.

524
00:46:12,410 --> 00:46:14,040
那个米茜 天啊 她…
And that Missy, boy, she just...

525
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:17,160
这件衣服真是超水平发挥 对吗 
outdid herself with the suit, right?

526
00:46:17,250 --> 00:46:20,080
- 还有这个材料的弹力… - 行了 你闭嘴吧
- And the elasticity in this fabric... - Okay, you can stop.

527
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:26,660
今天晚上真的很不容易
I know tonight was a lot.

528
00:46:28,330 --> 00:46:30,370
你和金并单打独斗
You took on Kingpin all by yourself.

529
00:46:32,620 --> 00:46:35,290
能在他手下活命的可没几个
Not many people walk away from somethin' like that.

530
00:46:37,250 --> 00:46:38,580
你太让我骄傲了
And I'm so proud of you.

531
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:44,580
谢谢
Thank you.

532
00:46:51,950 --> 00:46:55,450
对了 咱们还得遛狗呢
You know what? We gotta walk that dog.

533
00:46:55,540 --> 00:46:56,910
没错
Yeah, we do.

534
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:04,410
圣诞节

535
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:51,120
你来吗 
You coming?

536
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:52,950
好 来吧 好运
Yeah. Come on, Lucky.

537
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:56,200
我来真的合适吗 
Hey, are you sure this is okay?

538
00:47:57,660 --> 00:48:00,160
相信我 他们都很期待见到你
I'm telling you, they're very excited to meet you.

539
00:48:00,250 --> 00:48:02,290
- 爸爸 - 你来了
-Daddy! - Hey, there he is!

540
00:48:02,370 --> 00:48:05,040
- 孩子 圣诞快乐 - 你做到了
- Hey, buddy, Merry Christmas. -You made it.

541
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:06,250
你真的说话算话了
You kept your promise.

542
00:48:06,330 --> 00:48:08,330
- 拿着这些 - 你叫什么名字 
- Here, take something. -What's your name?

543
00:48:08,410 --> 00:48:10,580
- 谢谢你 圣诞快乐 - 圣诞快乐
- Thank you. Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas.

544
00:48:10,660 --> 00:48:12,790
这是凯特 进来吧
This is Kate. Come on in. Let's go.

545
00:48:12,870 --> 00:48:14,040
太冷了
It's cold.

546
00:48:14,910 --> 00:48:16,620
- 你赶上了 - 我赶上了
- You made it. -I made it.

547
00:48:17,790 --> 00:48:18,700
你好
Hey.

548
00:48:22,660 --> 00:48:26,250
- 我很想你 - 我也很想你
- I missed you. - I missed you too.

549
00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:30,700
这狗太可爱了 它叫什么 
Ah! The dog is so cute. What's his name?

550
00:48:30,790 --> 00:48:32,700
它叫好运
That's Lucky.

551
00:48:33,620 --> 00:48:34,950
对
Right, yeah.

552
00:48:35,410 --> 00:48:36,700
我带回来了些无家可归的家伙
Brought home a couple strays.

553
00:48:37,790 --> 00:48:38,870
- 你好 - 这是凯特
- Hi. - This is Kate.

554
00:48:38,950 --> 00:48:42,120
欢迎 凯特 欢迎你来家里
Welcome, Kate. So good to have you.

555
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:45,660
不会吧 这是我一直想要的
No way! I've always wanted one of these!

556
00:48:48,750 --> 00:48:50,500
你绝对猜不到
You're never gonna guess what was found

557
00:48:50,580 --> 00:48:53,250
我在纽约的黑市拍卖里找到了什么
